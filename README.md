# Test Driven Development (TDD) Practice
Repo for practicing principles involved with TDD. Practice areas:

- Exploration of the nUnit and xUnit APIs, and comparing/contrasting their features.
- Using mocks and fakes.
- Using fuzzing techniques to find weaknesses or vulnerabilities in code.
- Using new or framework-specific testing frameworks.
