# Testing Development Practice

Repo for practicing unit testing, UI automated testing, and principles involved with TDD. Practice areas:

- Exploration of the nUnit and xUnit APIs, and comparing/contrasting their features.
- Using mocks and fakes in unit tests.
- Using fuzzing techniques to find weaknesses or vulnerabilities in code.
- Using automated UI testing features.
- Using new or framework-specific testing frameworks.
